<!--don't need ID to submit a form, but it is used to click on the actual word such as username
and password and redirect it into their boxes-->
   <!-- forms need the name attribute for it to  be usuable-->

    <input id="username" name="username" type="text" value="username">
    <!-- text input has the option of values, where you can fill the box with a starting value that is editable
     or a placeholder that is not editable-->

    <input id="password" name="password" type="password">

    <!--the text area works similarly to text input, but it can hold much more user input.
     It does not have a value attribute, but you can put a starting value before closing the textarea tag-->

    <textarea name="bio" id="bio" cols="40" rows="5"></textarea>
    <input type="submit">

    <input type="checkbox" name="emailSignup" value="true" checked>Would you care to subscribe to our newsletter?-->
